</div></head>
<body>
  <p>   Hello! And welcome to my small, one page website about the wonderful pastries you can make on The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild! There are so many, however, that i will only be making so many of them. One cake, one pie, one crepe, one honeyed sweet, and then the honey candy, plus the special monster cake!
      I will be listing their effects, how to make them, and some images of the sweet desserts! </p>

      <h2><i>Firstly: Cake</i></h2>
      <p>The cake we are going to focus on for this website is the Fruitcake. The Fruitcake's in-game description is "Making ample use of fruits found all over Hyrule, this cake is a must for celebrations."
          The Fruitcake is made by combining:
          -Apple
          -Wildberry
          -Tabantha Wheat
          -Cane Sugar
          It heals a base of 8 hearts, but with the use of premium ingredients such as a big heart radish it can full recover, and give a bonus five temporary hearts! The fruitcake is also used in a sidequest named "A Royal Recipe."
      </p>
      <h3><i>Other Cakes:</i></h3>
      <p>Other cakes you can make that I will not go into detail on are:
          -Nutcake
          -Carrot Cake
          A cake we will talk about later is the special Monster Cake.
      </p>

      <h2><i>Pie</i></h2>
      <p>The pie in question is the Fruit Pie. It's in-game description is "A celebration isn't a celebration until this fruit-filled crust hits the table!"
          The Fruit Pie is made by combining:
        -Any fruit (with the exception of apples and pumpkins)
         -Tabantha Wheat
        -Cane Sugar
    -Goat Butter
    It heals a base of 3 hearts, but you can use premium ingredients such as Big Hearty Radishes to increase the number, as well as add effects such as Speed up by adding speed boosting ingredients like the Endura Carrot.</p>
    <h3><i>Other Pies:</i></h3>
    <p>Other pies that can be made that i will elaborate on here are:
        -Apple Pie
        -Pumpkin Pie</p>

        <h2><i>Crepes</i></h2>
        <p>Our crepe of question is the Wilberry Crepe! The Wildberry Crepe's in-game description is "Sweet, tart wildberries are folded into thin, springy dough to make this dessert."
            The Wildberry crep is made by combining:
        -Wildberry
        -Fresh Milk
         -Cane Sugar
        -Bird Egg
         -Tabantha Wheat
        The Wildberry Crepe heals 13 hearts and cannot be modified as it uses all five ingredient slots available to Link.</p>
        <h3><i>Other Crepes:</i></h3>
        <p>-Plain Crepe
            -Honey Crepe</p>

            <h2><i>Honeyed Sweets</i></h2>
            <p>The Honeyed Sweet in focus is the Honeyed Apple! The in-game description is "A juicy sweet-and-sour dish combining newley ripened apples with honey."
                The Honeyed Apple is made by combining:
                -Courser Bee Honey
                -Apple
                The Honeyed Apple heals 5 hearts and because it uses Courser Bee Honey it automatically restores 1/3 of Link's Stamina Wheel. You can add premium ingredients such as Big Hearty Radishes to increase hearts restored</p>
<h3><i>Other Honeyed Sweets:</i></h3>
<p>-Honeyed Fruit</p>

<h2><i>Honey Candy</i></h2>
<p>Honey candy is a unique dish, as in there are no other candies in the game, Honey Candy is the only one! It's in-game description is "Instantly refills some of your Stamina Wheel. A natural sweet, brimming with nutrition and made by stewing fresh honey." 
    It is only made with Courser Bee Honey, nothing else can be added as it changes the recipe to something else. It heals 2 hearts and refills 2/5 of a stamina wheel.</p>

<h2><i>Monster Cake</i></h2>
<p>Monster Cake is a special cake, like the rest of the monster recipes it requires a special ingredient only gotten from select NPCs as a reward for saving them, or the special Fang n Bone shop unlocked through a sidequest. It's in-game description is "It's said that once you have a taste of this cake, you'll never forget its sweetness."
    It is made with:
    -Monster Extract
    -Tabantha Wheat
    -Cane Sugar
    -Goat Butter
    You can add a fruit to increase hearts given. It heals a base of five hearts, but with the inclusion of a fruit it can add 3 hearts, plus if you use big hearty radishes or hearty durians it can give you up to 5 temporary hearts.</p>
